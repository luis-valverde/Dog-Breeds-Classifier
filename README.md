## Requirements

This project uses the following software and Python libraries:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-364/)
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [scikit-learn (v0.17)](https://scikit-learn.org/0.17/install.html)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html).

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the
[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and
more included.
